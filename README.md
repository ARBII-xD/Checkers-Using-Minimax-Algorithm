#A checkers AI using the minimax algorithm.
##ABOUT THE GAME:
It is the modern implementation of the classical Checkers game. It is 
implemented in python using Minimax Algorithm with the help of 
popular module pygame.
###• GAME PLAY:
Checkers is played with two players sitting across from each other the 
board is positioned with the light-colored square in the bottom right 
corner the checkers for each player are set up on the dark colored 
squaresthe object of the game is to capture all your opponent’s checkers 
or trap your opponent so no move can be made.
Player 1 begins the game by making the first move the checkers can 
move diagonally forward one space player 2 moves a checker for his turn 
players take turns moving one checker at a time a checker is captured by 
jumping the opponent's checker with your own checker a jump can be 
made when the square behind your opponent's checker is open more 
than one checker can be captured during a turn by multiple jumps being
made with the same checker player 2 is able to capture two of player 1's
checkers on this turn players continue to take turns making moves
skipping ahead if a player is able to move his checker to the other side of
the board that checker is kinged player 2 got a checker to the other side 
of the board and a checker is stacked on top to signify the checker being 
kinged a king checker can move forwards and backwards on the board
skipping ahead again player 2 is able to capture player 1's last two 
checkers and wins this game
###• GAME RULES:
A single checker can only move and jump going forward if a player can 
make a capture, he has to make the capture if a player cannot make a 
move, he loses that wraps up how to play checkers.
